In this repository you can find the projects that I worked on as part of the Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree

The HTML files here are actually Jupiter Notebooks files exported as HTML. In order to view them, please download the HTML file and open it with your favourite browser. 

The We Rate Dogs project contains 2 pdf files, one of these files describes how I wrangled the data, the other is an attempted blog post that I wrote to fullfill the requirements of the exercise.
